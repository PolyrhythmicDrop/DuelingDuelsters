At the start of a round, each player selects an **action**. Understanding what actions to take in certain situations is essential to surviving long enough to be crowned the most dueling Duelster of them all.

1. Swing your sword
-------------------
The swing action is the primary mode of attack for all classes. It's pretty simple: swing your sword and hope it hits your opponent.
If you're lucky, you may even score a critical hit! But be careful: if your attack is blocked, you'll be staggered and open for a counterattack in the next round.

2. Block with your shield
-------------------------
The block action allows you to reduce the damage you take from an attack or to negate an attack entirely.
If you successfully block a swing, your opponent becomes staggered. 
If you block during an opponent's dodge, any counterattack mounted by your opponent deals half damage and cannot result in a critical hit.

3. Dodge your opponent's attack
-------------------------------
The dodge action is a high risk, high reward action. 
If you successfully dodge an attack, you take no damage and have a chance to mount a powerful counterattack.
This counterattack has a much higher chance to land a critical hit than a normal swing attack. 
But be careful: if you dodge in the wrong direction, you'll be vulnerable to a critical hit yourself!

4. Heal yourself (MEDIC ONLY)
-----------------------------
The heal action is a unique action that is only available to the Medic class.
When you successfully heal, you restore between 1 and 10 points of Health. 
The Medic has a chance to dodge incoming swings while healing, but safety is far from guaranteed.

**WARNING** - You can only heal 3 times per match!!
