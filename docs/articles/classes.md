# Classes

In Dueling Duelsters, a character's class determines their statistics, their effectiveness at performing certain actions, and their strengths and weaknesses. Selecting the right class for your playstyle is an important step toward becoming a champion Duelster.

There are currently five classes in Dueling Duelsters:

* [Normie](#normie)
* [Fridge](#fridge)
* [Leeroy](#leeroy)
* [Gymnast](#gymnast)
* [Medic](#medic)

## Normie

A Normie is just that: utterly normal at every endeavor they undertake. Where other classes excel at a particular action and fall short at others, the Normie is decent at everything, but great at nothing.

Normies are good for testing out action combinations and switching tactics mid-battle. Although they cannot heal, they are reasonably good at absorbing damage and have a respectable pool of health. They won't be landing critical hits on each swing like the Gymnast or the Leeroy, but they can chip away at their opponent's health with the same effectiveness as your chatty but boring coworker wearing down your spirit at the watercooler.

### Statistics

* **Health** - 20
* **Attack** - 10
* **Defense** - 8
* **Speed** - 5

## Fridge

Much like Chicago Bears defensive tackle William Perry, a Fridge is built like a tank and lives to take a hit (or two, or twenty). A Fridge doesn't have the sharpest blade or the quickest feet, but they don't have to move much to wear their opponent down to an ineffective shell of a Duelster. You can't kill what you can't hurt.

Fridges excel at blocking and weathering hard hits, and their high health and defense makes killing them difficult. Their attack is low compared to other classes, but smart Fridges can compensate for this weakness by staggering their opponents with a well-placed block. Once staggered, opponents are vulnerable to critical hits, allowing the crafty Fridge to go on the offensive without worrying about being caught unawares by a harder-hitting or faster opponent.

### Statistics

* **Health** - 30
* **Attack** - 7
* **Defense** - 15
* **Speed** - 3

## Leeroy

A Leeroy has no time for strategy, little patience for putting on armor, and none of the fine motor skills required to lace up a pair of tennis shoes. While other Duelsters confer with their teammates on a wise, coordinated plan of attack, the Leeroy rushes in with a mighty battle cry, leaving their fate to the gods and the sharp edge of their sword.

Leeroys are all offense, all the time. Even the sturdy Fridge can have trouble defending against the onslaught of a Leeroy. Because their defense is so low, a Leeroy can't take many hits before succumbing to the blood-soaked dust of the arena, and their lack of speed makes dodging a risky endeavor. To compensate for the lack of staying power, the best strategy for a Leeroy is to swing for the fences: a few well-placed blows can end a match quickly before the Leeroy's opponent has a chance to react or defend themselves.

### Statistics

* **Health** - 16
* **Attack** - 16
* **Defense** - 4
* **Speed** - 6

## Gymnast

A Gymnast flows through the arena like water: when their opponent makes a mistake, the Gymnast crashes down with the power of a tsunami. When facing these nimble shadows, the wild flailings of a Leeroy sow the seeds of their own destruction, and a Fridge can end up blocking nothing but air.

 High speed and high counterattack capability are the hallmarks of a Gymnast. The bread and butter of a good Gymnast strategy is the effective use of dodging. A successful dodge compensates for the Gymnast's low defense by avoiding damage altogether and takes advantage of their high speed to devastate their opponent with a critical hit counterattack. Gymnasts can also use basic swings to finish off an opponent; though their attack power is relatively weak, their high speed makes critical hits all but guaranteed, allowing them to land a finishing blow with ease.

 ### Statistics

 * **Health** - 18
 * **Attack** - 8
 * **Defense** - 6
 * **Speed** - 12

## Medic

A Medic combines the endurance of a Fridge with the versatility of a Normie. The only class with a doctorate (or the concept of higher education), the Medic has the ability to heal their wounds on the fly through a combination of science and magic. They may not have much in the way of arena smarts, but they make up for it with durability and skill with a scalpel.

![Screenshot from Dueling Duelsters showing the description of the Medic class. The description reads "The only class that can heal, the Medic is durable and doesn't care one whit about the Hippocratic Oath."](~/docs/images/dueling-duelsters-medic-class.png)

The Medic is a good all-around character with a few special tricks up their sleeve. They won't dazzle you with speed, intimidate you with giant swords, or impress you with heavy armor, but they can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat with a well-placed heal. However, healing can leave the Medic open to a counterattack (especially against a fast opponent like the Gymnast) and they can only heal three times per match. As long as they keep track of how many heals they have remaining, the Medic can hit hard when they need to, defend against a wide range of attacks, and come out the victor through attrition and a healthy dose of smarts.

* **Attack** - 9
