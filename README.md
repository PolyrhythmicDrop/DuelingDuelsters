## Getting Started

The first step on the road to victory is being brave enough to enter the arena in the first place. Start your Dueling Duelsters journey in a few easy steps:

### Start a New Game

1. Download *DuelingDuelsters.exe* from the [Releases section](https://github.com/PolyrhythmicDrop/DuelingDuelsters/releases), then run *DuelingDuelsters.exe*.
2. Press the `1` key on your keyboard to start a new game.
3. Choose how many Duelsters will be dueling by pressing the appropriate key:
   1. **One Player** - You will fight against a computer-controlled opponent. Don't worry, you'll still determine your opponent's name and class.
   2. **Two Players** - You will fight against a human-controlled opponent. Be careful not to sabotage your relationships with loved ones by being too good at dueling.
   3. **Back to Title** - Arena too big for you? Cat suddenly needs attention? Opponent chickened out? Return to the title menu and contemplate your next move.

### Create the Characters

Congratulations on stepping into the arena! Next, you must create a character for each player.

1. Type out a name for your character. You can use **Backspace** to go back and correct mistakes.
2. Press **Enter** when you're satisfied with your character's name, or press **Escape** to go back to the player select menu.
3. Select your class by pressing the appropriate key. You can also let the game choose a class for you by pressing the `6` key.

> For more information on each class, refer to <xref:classes>.

4. Your new character's stats and name display. Make sure you're happy with what you see, then press the **Y** key to continue. If you want to go back, press the **N** key or **Escape**.
5. Create a character for Player Two by following the same process.
6. ***Duel!***

### Your First Duel

Now that you're face to face with your opponent, sword in hand, crowd baying for blood, your rigorous Duelster training may flee your brain. Fear not, because a duel is a very simple thing that you'll master in no time.

Each duel (or **match**) is divided into a series of **rounds**. In each round, both players select an **action**. These two actions combine to create an **outcome** for the round.

At the end of a round, players take damage, heal their wounds, become staggered, execute counterattacks, or endure the jeers of the crowd based on the round's outcome. The next round begins and the cycle continues until one player's health reaches 0. At that point, the duel is over and a victor is declared.

You've completed your first duel! Whether you survived or not is a matter of skill and chance, but you can always dust yourself off and try again if you succumb to your opponent.
